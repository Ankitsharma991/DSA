    /* 
     * Take a starting point (any vertex)
     * Start printing the immediate neighbours of current vertex before moving to next vertex make sure all neighbours of previous vertex are visited and no vertex are traversed more than once.
     * Note: BFS in Graph is like level order traversal of Binary tree.
     * we used queue for level order traversal so, here we also need to use a queue
     * while traversing a graph we need a queue and an array where we use array to store the visited node of the graph and queue is used to store the neighbours of the graph.
     * For visiting any node we require these three steps: 
        1. print (currentNode)
        2. visited[currentNode] = true;
        3. Add the neighbours of currentNode to the Queue
